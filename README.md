# BuyCongress

BuyCongress is an iOS app and Safari extension that allows you to uncover the influence money has on your civil servants by drawing connections between representatives and the organizations that donate to them.

**NOTE:** *The Sunlight Foundation's Transparency Data API that this application relies upon has been shutdown.* Without this API or a substantial rewrite of the codebase, this application will no longer show the donation data for politicians.

For more information about why the API was retired, see http://influenceexplorer.com/deprecation/

Available now on the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buycongress/id951958447
